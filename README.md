# Power Monitoring System

The given code and hardware setup were implemented to monitor the **voltage** and **current** flowing through both the **Transmitter Coil** and **Receiver Coil**.  

The **prototype design** was developed to monitor **power consumption** and **efficiency** when the coils are **misaligned**.
